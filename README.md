# 💸 SplitFund

**SplitFund** is a smart group expense manager that uses a virtual “Group Wallet” and weighted splitting to handle real-life scenarios like families, couples, and singles travelling or dining together. Instead of entering expenses only after the trip, SplitFund helps you track and split costs fairly in near real time, without moving any real money.

## 😇 Technologics

- **FrontEnd**:  HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **BackEnd**: Python (Flask)
- **DataBase**: SQLAlchemy

## 🤩 Features

What you can do with **SplitFund**:
 
- Create trips/groups and add members (Families, Couples, Singles)
- Set a virtual **“pre‑paid”** amount for each member

- Add expenses with:
  - Amount, description, category
  - Who paid ?
  - Who participated ?
  - Split rule (equal, per-family, weighted, custom)

- Smart splitting algorithm with weights and exclusions
- Real-time virtual balances and net positions
- Final Settlement summary: minimal set of “A pays B ₹X” suggestions

## 👨‍💻 The Process

We "TheOnlyCoders" have built this website/app with all of our hardwork and dedication. This is a group conmetition that we have came a long way doing so. There were many times where our code initially failed due some minor and inconsistent code. But with the help of my team we eventually overcome all the challenges.

This opportunity was given by **AVISHKAAR- South India's Biggest Hackathon** and this was conducted on 25 November 2025. Our problem statement was as follows: The Dynamic "Group Wallet" & Smart Splitting. Traditional expense splitting apps (like Splitwise) are retrospective—you enter costs after spending. They also struggle with complex scenarios (e.g., one family of 4, one couple, and one single person dining together where the single person didn't drink alcohol).

We initially started researching about the app which was mentioned in the problem statement, after gaining enough knowledge about the problem, we started to work on the solution one by one. Exchange of ideas and we later found out what to do and started working on it. After 3-4 hours our basic UI/UX was created. Logic and Calculation part was later included in it as well but with the most efforts.

Now, SplitFund is open to the public and we hope that it would help others to improve as well as update our ideas, so that, we can learn and understand from our mistakes to be better in the future.


## 📈 Overall Growth

Each part of this project helped me understand more about building apps, managing complex information and improving user experience. It was more than just making an app, it was about solving problems, learning new things and improving my skills for the future work.

## 🚦Running the Project

To run the project in a local environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Download "`Live Server`" extension from Extensions in Visual Studio Code for easily executing the code.
3. Open the `URL address` shown in your console to your browser to view the app. (Like [http://localhost:5170]())
